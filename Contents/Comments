This will be me tracking my progress with Java by committing progress
to GitHub. I'm hoping to one day become a Software Developer 
	IE: HW, Personal projects, Textbook practice
Book I will be using: How to Program (Early Objects)- 10th Edition by P. Deitel and H. Deitel

Looking forward to the journey.
